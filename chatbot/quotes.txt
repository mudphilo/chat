Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to<br><br>predict the future is to invent it.<br><br>-- Alan Kay<br><br>
Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it)<br><br>in programming.<br><br>-- Donald Knuth<br><br>
Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to misuse a<br><br>computer". I think that description is a great compliment because it<br><br>transmits the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our<br><br>most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.<br><br>-- Edsger Dijkstra, CACM, 15:10<br><br>
Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people<br><br>always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can<br><br>become great.<br><br>-- Mark Twain<br><br>
What Paul does, and does very well, is to take ideas and concepts that<br><br>are beautiful in the abstract, and brings them down to a real world<br><br>level. That's a rare talent to find in writing these days.<br><br>-- Jeff "hemos" Bates, Director, OSDN; Co-evolver, Slashdot<br><br>
Since programmers create programs out of nothing, imagination is our<br><br>only limitation. Thus, in the world of programming, the hero is the one<br><br>who has great vision. Paul Graham is one of our contemporary heroes. He<br><br>has the ability to embrace the vision, and to express it plainly. His<br><br>works are my favorites, especially the ones describing language design.<br><br>He explains secrets of programming, languages, and human nature that can<br><br>only be learned from the hacker experience. This book shows you his<br><br>great vision, and tells you the truth about the nature of hacking.<br><br>-- Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, creator of Ruby<br><br>

Students should be evaluated on how well they can achieve the goals they<br><br>strived to achieve within a realistic context. Students need to learn to<br><br>do things, not know things.<br><br>-- Roger Schank, Engines for Education<br><br>
We remember what we learn when we care about performing better and when<br><br>we believe that what we have been asked to do is representative of<br><br>reality.<br><br>-- Roger Schank, Engines for Education<br><br>
There really is no learning without doing.<br><br>-- Roger Schank, Engines for Education<br><br>
We really have to get over the idea that some stuff is just worth<br><br>knowing even if you never do anything with it. Human memories happily<br><br>erase stuff that has no purpose, so why try to fill up children's heads<br><br>with such stuff?<br><br>-- Roger Schank, Engines for Education<br><br>
La tactique, c'est ce que vous faites quand il y a quelque chose à<br><br>faire; la stratégie, c'est ce que vous faites quand il n'y a rien à<br><br>faire.<br><br>-- Xavier Tartacover<br><br>
The only problems we can really solve in a satisfactory manner are those<br><br>that finally admit a nicely factored solution.<br><br>-- E. W. Dijkstra, The humble programmer<br><br>
The best way to learn to live with our limitations is to know them.<br><br>--E. W. Dijkstra, The humble programmer<br><br>
This challenge, viz. the confrontation with the programming task, is so<br><br>unique that this novel experience can teach us a lot about ourselves. It<br><br>should deepen our understanding of the processes of design and creation,<br><br>it should give us better control over the task of organizing our<br><br>thoughts. If it did not do so, to my taste we should no deserve the<br><br>computer at all!  It has allready taught us a few lessons, and the one I<br><br>have chosen to stress in this talk is the following. We shall do a much<br><br>better programming job, provided that we approach the task with a full<br><br>appreciation of its tremenduous difficulty, provided that we stick to<br><br>modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the<br><br>intrinsec limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very<br><br>Humble Programmers.<br><br>-- E.

We now come to the decisive step of mathematical abstraction: we forget<br><br>about what the symbols stand for. ...[The mathematician] need not be<br><br>idle; there are many operations which he may carry out with these<br><br>symbols, without ever having to look at the things they stand for.<br><br>-- Hermann Weyl, The Mathematical Way of Thinking<br><br>
An expert is, according to my working definition "someone who doesn't<br><br>need to look up answers to easy questions".<br><br>-- Eric Lippert.<br><br>
The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of<br><br>collection.<br><br>-- Alan J. Perlis<br><br>
Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally<br><br>for machines to execute.<br><br>-- Alan J. Perlis<br><br>
We control complexity by building abstractions that hide details when<br><br>appropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventional<br><br>interfaces that enable us to construct systems by combining standard,<br><br>well-understood pieces in a ``mix and match'' way. We control complexity<br><br>by establishing new languages for describing a design, each of which<br><br>emphasizes particular aspects of the design and deemphasizes others.<br><br>-- Alan J. Perlis<br><br>
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are<br><br>chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound<br><br>one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two<br><br>ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one<br><br>another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into<br><br>one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is<br><br>separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real<br><br>existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas<br><br>are made.<br><br>-- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)<br><br>
Lisp programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing.<br><br>-- Alan J. Perlis<br><br>

When your enemy is making a very serious mistake, don't be impolite and<br><br>disturb him.<br><br>-- Napoleon Bonaparte (allegedly)<br><br>
A charlatan makes obscure what is clear; a thinker makes clear what is<br><br>obscure.<br><br>-- Hugh Kingsmill<br><br>
There are two ways of constructing a software design; one way is to make<br><br>it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way<br><br>is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The<br><br>first method is far more difficult.<br><br>-- C. A. R. Hoare<br><br>
And if you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen.<br><br>Sometimes smart thinkers just don't know when to stop, and they create<br><br>these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe that<br><br>are all good and fine, but don't actually mean anything at all.<br><br>-- Joel Spolsky		<br><br>

He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on<br><br>the righteous and the unrighteous.<br><br>-- Matthew 5:45<br><br>
A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is<br><br>not worth knowing.<br><br>-- Alan Perlis<br><br>
Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le loisir<br><br>de la faire plus courte. (I have made this letter so long only because I<br><br>did not have the leisure to make it shorter.)<br><br>-- Blaise Pascal (Lettres Provinciales)<br><br>

If we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as *lines<br><br>produced* but as *lines spent*.<br><br>-- Edsger Dijkstra		<br><br>
Sometimes a man with too broad a perspective reveals himself as having<br><br>no real perspective at all. A man who tries too hard to see every side<br><br>may be a man who is trying to avoid choosing any side. A man who tries<br><br>too hard to seek a deeper truth may be trying to hide from the truth he<br><br>already knows.  That is not a sign of intellectual sophistication and<br><br>"great thinking". It is a demonstration of moral degeneracy and<br><br>cowardice.<br><br>-- Steven Den Beste<br><br>
Omit needless words.<br><br>-- William Strunk, Jr. (The Elements of Style)<br><br>
I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from<br><br>him.<br><br>-- Galileo Galilei<br><br>
A society that puts equality -- in the sense of equality of outcome --<br><br>ahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom. The use<br><br>of force to achieve equality will destroy freedom, and the force,<br><br>introduced for good purposes, will end up in the hands of people who use<br><br>it to promote their own interests.<br><br>-- Milton Friedman (Thomas Sowell: A Conflict of Visions, p130)<br><br>
Philosophy: the finding of bad reasons for what one believes by<br><br>instinct.<br><br>-- Brave New World (paraphrased)<br><br>
Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its<br><br>victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under<br><br>robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies, The robber baron's<br><br>cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated;<br><br>but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end, for<br><br>they do so with the approval of their own conscience.<br><br>-- C.S.

The function of wisdom is to discriminate between good and evil.<br><br>-- Cicero<br><br>
The reason to do animation is caricature. Good caricature picks out the<br><br>essense of the statement and removes everything else. It's not simply<br><br>about reproducing reality; It's about bumping it up.<br><br>-- Brad Bird, writer and director, The Incredibles<br><br>

Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you<br><br>will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a<br><br>better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually<br><br>use Lisp itself a lot.<br><br>-- Eric S. Raymond<br><br>

While I’ve always appreciated beautiful code, I share Jonathan’s concern<br><br>about studying it too much. I think studying beauty in music and<br><br>painting has led us to modern classical music and painting that the<br><br>majority of us just don’t get. Beauty can be seen when it emerges, but<br><br>isn’t something to strive for in isolation of a larger context. In the<br><br>software world, the larger context would be the utility of the software<br><br>to the end user.<br><br>-- [A comment on a blog]<br><br>

To do something well you have to love it. So to the extent you can<br><br>preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it well. Try<br><br>to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at age 14. If<br><br>you're worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably<br><br>is.<br><br>-- Paul Graham.<br><br>

What I didn't understand was that the value of some new acquisition<br><br>wasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for it.<br><br>It was the value I derived from it. Stuff is an extremely illiquid<br><br>asset. Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable thing you got<br><br>so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's "worth?" The only way<br><br>you're ever going to extract any value from it is to use it. And if you<br><br>don't have any immediate use for it, you probably never will.<br><br>-- Paul Graham<br><br>
Only bad designers blame their failings on the users.<br><br>-- unknown<br><br>
Humans aren't rational -- they rationalize. And I don't just mean "some<br><br>of them" or "other people". I'm talking about everyone. We have a "logic<br><br>engine" in our brains, but for the most part, it's not the one in the<br><br>driver's seat -- instead it operates after the fact, generating<br><br>rationalizations and excuses for our behavior.<br><br>-- Paul Buchheit<br><br>
What do Americans look for in a car? I've heard many answers when I've<br><br>asked this question. The answers include excellent safety ratings, great<br><br>gas mileage, handling, and cornering ability, among others. I don't<br><br>believe any of these. That's because the first principle of the Culture<br><br>Code is that the only effective way to understand what people truly mean<br><br>is to ignore what they say. This is not to suggest that people<br><br>intentionally lie or misrepresent themselves. What it means is that,<br><br>when asked direct questions about their interests and preferences,<br><br>people tend to give answers they believe the questioner wants to hear.<br><br>Again, this is not because they intend to mislead. It is because people<br><br>respond to these questions with their cortexes, the parts of their<br><br>brains that control intelligence rather than emotion or instinct. They<br><br>ponder a question, they process a question, and when they deliver an<br><br>answer, it is the product of deliberation. They believe they are telling<br><br>the truth. A lie detector would confirm this. In most cases, however,<br><br>they aren't saying what they mean.<br><br>-- The culture code.<br><br>

The lesson of the story might appear to be that self-interested and<br><br>ambitious people in power are often the cause of wastefulness in<br><br>developing countries.

Being a programmer is the same way. The only way to be a good programmer<br><br>is to write code. When you realize you haven't been writing much code<br><br>lately, and it seems like all you do is brag about code you wrote in the<br><br>past, and people start looking at you funny while you're shooting your<br><br>mouth off, realize it's because they know.

My dream is that people adopt it on its own merits. We're not trying to<br><br>bend Ruby on Rails to fit the enterprise, we're encouraging enterprises<br><br>to bend to Ruby on Rails.

Let me try to get this straight: Lisp is a language for describing<br><br>algorithms. This was JohnMcCarthy's original purpose, anyway: to build<br><br>something more convenient than a Turing machine. Lisp is not about file,<br><br>socket or GUI programming - Lisp is about expressive power. (For<br><br>example, you can design multiple object systems for Lisp, in Lisp. Or<br><br>implement the now-fashionable AOP. Or do arbitrary transformations on<br><br>parsed source code.) If you don't value expressive power, Lisp ain't for<br><br>you. I, personally, would prefer Lisp to not become mainstream: this<br><br>would necessarily involve a dumbing down.<br><br>-- VladimirSlepnev<br><br>
Je ne vous impose aucune contrainte, aucune limite. Surprenez-moi,<br><br>étonnez-moi, défiez-moi, défiez-vous vous-même. Vous avez le choix: vous<br><br>pouvez rester dans l'ombre ou en sortir en étant parmis les trop rares<br><br>exceptions à avoir réussi. L'heure est venue d'aller bien au delà de<br><br>votre potentiel. L'heure est venue maintenant de descendre vraiment en<br><br>vous. L'heure est venue de démontrer pourquoi vous êtes l'élite, les<br><br>quelques élus, les rares lueurs qui offrent à cette compagnie son<br><br>caractère exceptionnel, sa luminescence.<br><br>-- Le PDG de NURV, dans "Anti-trust".<br><br>
If something isn’t working, you need to look back and figure out what<br><br>got you excited in the first place.<br><br>-- David Gorman (ImThere.com)<br><br>
Opportunities that present themselves to you are the consequence -- at<br><br>least partially -- of being in the right place at the right time. They<br><br>tend to present themselves when you're not expecting it -- and often<br><br>when you are engaged in other activities that would seem to preclude you<br><br>from pursuing them. And they come and go quickly -- if you don't jump<br><br>all over an opportunity, someone else generally will and it will vanish.<br><br>-- Marc Andreessen (http://blog.pmarca.com/)<br><br>
Pay attention to opportunity cost at all times. Doing one thing means<br><br>not doing other things. This is a form of risk that is very easy to<br><br>ignore, to your detriment.<br><br>-- Marc Andreessen (http://blog.pmarca.com/)<br><br>
Seize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity. They are<br><br>rare, much rarer than you think...<br><br>-- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, "The Black Swan".<br><br>
I think that a lot of programmers are ignoring an important point when<br><br>people talk about reducing code repetition on large projects.<br><br>Part of the idea is that large projects are intrinsically *wrong*. That<br><br>you should be looking at making a number of smaller projects that are<br><br>composable, even if you never end up reusing one of those smaller<br><br>projects elsewhere.<br><br>-- Dan Nugent<br><br>
We tend to seek easy, single-factor explanations of success. For most<br><br>important things, though, success actually requires avoiding many<br><br>separate causes of failure.<br><br>-- Jared Diamond<br><br>
Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which<br><br>matter least.<br><br>-- Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe (1749-1832)<br><br>
I think the root of your mistake is saying that macros don't scale to<br><br>larger groups. The real truth is that macros don't scale to stupider<br><br>groups.<br><br>-- Paul Graham, on the Lightweight Languages mailing list.<br><br>
Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.<br><br>If you compete with slaves you become a slave.<br><br>-- Paul Graham and Norbert Weiner, respectively<br><br>
Always dive down into a problem and get your hands on the deepest issue<br><br>behind the problem. All other considerations are to dismissed as<br><br>"engineering details"; they can be sorted out after the basic problem<br><br>has been solved.<br><br>-- Chris Crawford<br><br>
Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.<br><br>-- Alan Perlis<br><br>
It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally<br><br>vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead. <br><br>-- Edsger Dijkstra<br><br>
If we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as lines<br><br>produced but as lines spent.<br><br>-- Edsger Dijkstra<br><br>
The most damaging phrase in the language is, It's always been done that<br><br>way.<br><br>-- Rear Admiral Grace Hopper<br><br>
Getting back to failing early, I've learned it's important to completely<br><br>fail. Get fired. Shoot the project, then burn its corpse. Melt the CVS<br><br>repository and microwave the backup CDs. When things go wrong, I've<br><br>often tried to play the hero from start to finish. Guess what? Some<br><br>projects are doomed no matter what. Some need skills I don't possess.<br><br>And some need a fresh face.<br><br>-- Reginald Braithwaite<br><br>
The only thing a man should ever be 100% convinced of is his own<br><br>ignorance.<br><br>-- DJ MacLean<br><br>
The best people and organizations have the attitude of wisdom: The<br><br>courage to act on what they know right now and the humility to change<br><br>course when they find better evidence.<br><br>The quest for management magic and breakthrough ideas is overrated;<br><br>being a master of the obvious is underrated.<br><br>Jim Maloney is right: Work is an overrated activity<br><br>-- Bob Sutton<br><br>
In theory, there’s no difference between theory and practice. But in<br><br>practice, there is.<br><br>-- Albert Einstein<br><br>
Act from reason, and failure makes you rethink and study harder.<br><br>Act from faith, and failure makes you blame someone and push harder.<br><br>--  Erik Naggum<br><br>

The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton.  Hoping to<br><br>prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said "Master, I have heard that<br><br>objects are a very good thing - is this true?"  Qc Na looked pityingly at<br><br>his student and replied, "Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's<br><br>closures."<br><br>Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell,<br><br>intent on studying closures.  He carefully read the entire "Lambda: The<br><br>Ultimate..." series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small<br><br>Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system.  He learned much, and<br><br>looked forward to informing his master of his progress.<br><br>On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by<br><br>saying "Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand<br><br>that objects are truly a poor man's closures."  Qc Na responded by hitting<br><br>Anton with his stick, saying "When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's<br><br>object."  At that moment, Anton became enlightened.<br><br>-- Anton van Straaten (Na = Norman Adams, Qa = Christian Queinnec)<br><br>

Simplicity and pragmatism beat complexity and theory any day.<br><br>-- Dennis (blog comment)<br><br>
The proof is by reductio ad absurdum, and reductio ad absurdum, which<br><br>Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician’s finest weapons. It is<br><br>a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the<br><br>sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the<br><br>game.<br><br>-- G. H.

A no uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a yes merely<br><br>uttered to please or what is worse, to avoid trouble.<br><br>-- Mahatma Gandhi<br><br>
I think it is wise, and only honest, to warn you that my goal is<br><br>immodest. It is not my purpose to "transfer knowledge" to you that,<br><br>subsequently, you can forget again. My purpose is no less than to<br><br>effectuate in each of you a noticeable, irreversable change. I want you<br><br>to gain, for the rest of your lives, the insight that beautiful proofs<br><br>are not "found" by trial anf error but are the result of a consciously<br><br>applied design discipline. I want you to raise your quality standards. I<br><br>mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and<br><br>dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and<br><br>say to yourself "Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would<br><br>be enough immortality for me.<br><br>-- E. W. Dijkstra<br><br>
The general principle for complexity design is this: Think locally, act<br><br>locally.<br><br>-- Richard P. Gabriel & Ron Goldman, Mob Software: The Erotic Life of Code<br><br>
Programming is the art of figuring out what you want so precisely that<br><br>even a machine can do it.<br><br>-- Some guy who isn't famous<br><br>
Hence my urgent advice to all of you to reject the morals of the<br><br>bestseller society and to find, to start with, your reward in your own<br><br>fun. This is quite feasible, for the challenge of simplification is so<br><br>fascinating that, if we do our job properly, we shall have the greatest<br><br>fun in the world.<br><br>-- E. W.

Remember: you are alone. Every time you can get help from someone,<br><br>it is an opportunity: you should eagerly size it. But then, promptly<br><br>return to normal mode: you are alone and you must be prepared to solve<br><br>every problem yourself.<br><br>-- Eric KEDJI<br><br>

Rules of Optimization:<br><br>Rule 1: Don’t do it.<br><br>Rule 2 (for experts only): Don’t do it yet.<br><br>-- M.A. Jackson<br><br>
More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without<br><br>necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason - including<br><br>blind stupidity.<br><br>-- W.A. Wulf<br><br>
We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:<br><br>premature optimization is the root of all evil.<br><br>-- Donald Knuth<br><br>
The best is the enemy of the good.<br><br>-- Voltaire<br><br>
The job of a leader today is not to create followers. It’s to create<br><br>more leaders.<br><br>-- Ralph Nader<br><br>
The president was visiting NASA headquarters and stopped to talk to a<br><br>man who was holding a mop. “And what do you do?” he asked. The man, a<br><br>janitor, replied, “I’m helping to put a man on the moon, sir.”<br><br>-- The little book of leadership<br><br>

Photography is painting with light.<br><br>-- Eric Hamilton<br><br>
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.<br><br>-- Pablo Picasso<br><br>
A guideline in the process of stepwise refinement should be the<br><br>principle to decompose decisions as much as possible, to untangle<br><br>aspects which are only seemingly interdependent, and to defer those<br><br>decisions which concern details of representation as long as possible.<br><br>-- Niklaus Wirth<br><br>
Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary<br><br>words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a<br><br>drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary<br><br>parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or<br><br>avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word<br><br>tell.<br><br>-- William Strunk, Jr. (The Elements of Style)<br><br>
The problem is that small examples fail to convince, and large examples<br><br>are too big to follow.<br><br>-- Steve Yegge.<br><br>
We are the sum of our behaviours; excellence therefore is not an act but<br><br>a habit.<br><br>-- Aristotle.<br><br>
The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new<br><br>semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.<br><br>-- Edsger Dijkstra<br><br>
Every man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment.<br><br>-- Seneca<br><br>
It’s hard to grasp abstractions if you don’t understand what they’re<br><br>abstracting away from.<br><br>-- Nathan Weizenbaum<br><br>
That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and the<br><br>real world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact,<br><br>the whole concept of a "good effort" is a fake idea adults invented to<br><br>encourage kids. It is not found in nature.<br><br>-- Paul Graham<br><br>

Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better<br><br>idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and<br><br>better idiots.  So far the Universe is winning.<br><br>-- Rich Cook<br><br>
A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a few<br><br>months–something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would<br><br>have a hard time getting together over a year.  IBM used to report that<br><br>certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other<br><br>workers, or more.<br><br>-- Peter Seebach<br><br>
The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones.<br><br>They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard:<br><br>conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving<br><br>ability.<br><br>-- Randall E. Stross<br><br>
A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average<br><br>lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000<br><br>times the price of an average software writer.<br><br>-- Bill Gates<br><br>
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring<br><br>aircraft building progress by weight.<br><br>-- Bill Gates<br><br>

The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only<br><br>off by a bit.<br><br>-- Anonymous<br><br>
Should array indices start at 0 or 1?  My compromise of 0.5 was rejected<br><br>without, I thought, proper consideration.<br><br>-- Stan Kelly-Bootle<br><br>

Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to<br><br>think out every case.<br><br>-- Francis Glassborow<br><br>
Considering the current sad state of our computer programs, software<br><br>development is clearly still a black art, and cannot yet be called an<br><br>engineering discipline.<br><br>-- Bill Clinton<br><br>
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be<br><br>the process of putting them in.<br><br>-- Edsger W. Dijkstra<br><br>
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a<br><br>violent psychopath who knows where you live.<br><br>-- Martin Golding<br><br>

I think there’s a world market for about 5 computers.<br><br>-- Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948<br><br>
It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible<br><br>to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with<br><br>such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years. <br><br>-- John Von Neumann, circa 1949<br><br>

If it keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button<br><br>finger.<br><br>-- Frank Lloyd Wright<br><br>
Functional programming is like describing your problem to a<br><br>mathematician.  Imperative programming is like giving instructions to<br><br>an idiot.<br><br>-- arcus, #scheme on Freenode<br><br>
Its a shame that the students of our generation grew up with windows and<br><br>mice because that tainted our mindset not to think in terms of powerful<br><br>tools. Some of us are just so tainted that we will never recover.<br><br>-- Jeffrey Mark Siskind <qobi@research.nj.nec.com> in comp.lang.lisp<br><br>
Lisp is a programmable programming language.<br><br>-- John Foderaro<br><br>
I guess, when you're drunk, every woman looks beautiful and every<br><br>language looks (like) a Lisp :)<br><br>-- Lament, #scheme@freenode.net<br><br>
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they<br><br>were to success when they gave up.<br><br>-- Thomas Edison<br><br>
You must always work not just within but below your means. If you can<br><br>handle three elements, handle only two. If you can handle ten, then<br><br>handle five. In that way the ones you do handle, you handle with more<br><br>ease, more mastery and you create a feeling of strength in reserve.<br><br>-- Pablo Picasso<br><br>
When you’ve got the code all ripped apart, it’s like a car that’s all<br><br>disassembled. You’ve got all the parts tying all over your garage and<br><br>you have to replace the broken part or the car will never run. It’s not<br><br>fun until the code gets back to the baseline again.<br><br>-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).<br><br>

Well, if you talk about programming to a group of programmers who use<br><br>the same language, they can become almost evangelistic about the<br><br>language. They form a tight-knit community, hold to certain beliefs, and<br><br>follow certain rules in their programming. It’s like a church with a<br><br>programming language for a Bible.<br><br>-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).<br><br>
It’s a problem if the design doesn’t let you add features at a later<br><br>date. If you have to redo a program, the hours you spend can cause you<br><br>to lose your competitive edge. A flexible program demonstrates the<br><br>difference between a good designer and someone who is just getting a<br><br>piece of code out.<br><br>-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).<br><br>
[How friendly will this machine be?] Well, I don’t think it’s a matter<br><br>of friendliness, because ultimately if the program is going to<br><br>accomplish anything of value, it will probably be relatively complex.<br><br>-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).<br><br>
Some people suggest that machines would be friendlier if input could be<br><br>in a natural language. But natural language is probably the worst kind<br><br>of input because it can be quite ambiguous. The process of retrieving<br><br>information from the computer would be so time-consuming that you would<br><br>be better off spending that time getting the information directly from<br><br>an expert.<br><br>-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).<br><br>
The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a<br><br>little way past them into the impossible.<br><br>-- Arthur C. Clarke<br><br>
Any sufficiently advanced technology is undistinguishable from magic.<br><br>-- Arthur C. Clarke<br><br>
That is the inevitable human response. We’re reluctant to believe that<br><br>great discoveries are in the air.

A person won't become proficient at something until he or she has done<br><br>it many times. In other words., if you want someone to be really good at<br><br>building a software system, he or she will have to have built 10 or more<br><br>systems of that type.<br><br>-- Philip Greenspun<br><br>
A person won't retain proficiency at a task unless he or she has at one<br><br>time learned to perform that task very rapidly.

If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's<br><br>a duck.<br><br>-- Official definition of "duck typing"<br><br>
In OO, it's the data that is the "important" thing: you define the class<br><br>which contains member data, and only incidentally contains code for<br><br>manipulating the object. In FP, it's the code that's important: you<br><br>define a function which contains code for working with the data, and<br><br>only incidentally define what the data is.<br><br>-- almkgor, on reddit<br><br>

The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way<br><br>that will allow a solution.<br><br>-- Bertrand Russell<br><br>

[Innovation] comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don’t<br><br>get on the wrong track or try to do too much.

Workers of the world, the chains that bind you are not held in place by<br><br>a ruling class, a "superior" race, by society, the state, or a leader.<br><br>They are held in place by none other than yourself. Those who seek to<br><br>exploit are not themselves free, for they place no value in freedom. Who<br><br>is it that really employs you and commands you to pick up your daily<br><br>load? And who is it that you allow to pass judgment on the adequacy of<br><br>your toil? Who have you empowered to dangle the carrot before you and<br><br>threaten with disapproval? Who, when you wake each morning, sends you<br><br>off to what you call your work?<br><br>Is there an "I want to" behind all your "I have to," or have you been so<br><br>long forgotten to yourself that "I want" exists only as an idea in your<br><br>head? If you have disconnected from your soul's desire and are drowning<br><br>in an ocean of "have to," then rise up and overthrow your master. Begin<br><br>the journey toward emancipation.  Work only in such a way that you are<br><br>truly self-employed.<br><br>-- Tim Gallwey, The inner game of work<br><br>
